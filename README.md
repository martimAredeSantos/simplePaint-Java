# simplePaint-Java

A simple Monochrome Paint to test Mapping and Mouse Handling. Click to Paint! 

![paint no clicks](https://github.com/martimAredeSantos/simplePaint-Java/assets/147712420/9e2df42a-08b8-43c8-95e4-a00baecab83d)

When you click, it converts the pixels to coordinates to get the Rectangle from a `HashMap<coordinate,Rectangle>` and fill it.

Test version to check where the click is being registered and if the conversion to coordinates / get Rectangle from HashMap is being done correctly.

Going to remake this in JS with more functionalities.
